#+TITLE: CV

Edit resume.tex and cover-letter.tex

Or edit cover-letter.org, but do C-c C-e L and edit the resulting tex. Make
sure thare is a first line, no matter what, then save as cover-letter-body.tex

Insert this for bullet instead of circles for listpoints:
: #+LATEX: \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\textbullet}

For different list spacing replace =\being{...= with the following in the latex file:
: \begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip5pt \parsep0pt

Then run =make-cv.sh=.

** TODO: 
- The personal info is duplicated from resume.tex to cover-letter.tex. Should
  make it one tex file or assemble a tex file from fragments script wise. 
- Insert company name automatically from script

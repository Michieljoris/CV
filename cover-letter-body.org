Dear reader,
 
I am a Dutchman who has been living in Australia since 1994.

I am self-taught in both programming and piano. I began programming in my early
teens and started playing piano at nineteen. I finished a conservatorium
education in Australia in my mid twenties. Programming has been an undercurrent
throughout my whole life, and after having explored music for some time I
focused on programming since about 2012-13.

I hope to bring thoroughness, ideas and architectural (and artistic) insight to
a team and projects. I enjoy designing and thinking about long term design and
implementation of these designs.

# I can explain what I understand. In a team I'm the 'yes but' person.

# Also: libraries over frameworks, beauty over speed, minimum code over added features.
 
My coding environment: laptop running Linux (Ubuntu), i3wm, Emacs and
Chrome/Firefox, my own tools. All my code is on [[http://github.com/michieljoris][github]]. A guide is on my site at
/[[https://www.axion5.net/my-github.html][axion5.net/my-github.html]]/.
 
Some more background info:
 
- I went to VWO (Science preparatory school), courses in maths, history and philosophy at Universities of Leiden and Amsterdam. Degree in piano at Brisbane Griffith Conservatorium. 
- Favorite language is lisp after working through TEOCS in Common Lisp.
- Wrote my own server, build and module system. It does for me what most people use Express, Grunt/Gulp/Brunch and Browserify for.
- Java and C++ put me thoroughly off OOP. Functional approach is better.
- Studying CS curriculum when time allows (SICP will be finished one day)
- Working knowledge of html and css (and sass and less etc), but not overly fond of it.
- Would love to write in and learn more about Haskell and Erlang, but also D, Rust and Julia.
- Dream project: write Lisp operating system.. 
- Major long term interest: computer systems' software reliability, robustness. Ultimately
  software should be somehow self repairing, self-reliant and with built-in
  redundancy, and as a whole extremely fault tolerant.

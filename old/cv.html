Advice for Contacting Michiel
The future is in web applications. Looking for similar minded people interested in building these using the best languages, the smartest libraries and clever implementations resulting in quick deployment. Am interested in learning and applying anything to further that goal. 
</p>
<p>
Interests beyond web applications are distributed programming, operating systems, compilers but foremost robustness, reliability and ease of use of computer systems. A computer shouldn't fail but it does so often.

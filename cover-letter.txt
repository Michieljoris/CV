Dear <..>

Attached is my CV for your consideration.

- Obviously sparse.., maybe excuse the slightly longer cover letter. Apologize
 for asking the addressee to take the extra time.
- Self taught pianist and programmer, autodidact.
- Science preparatory school, maths, philosophy and history at uni in Amsterdam before
 settling on piano, finished music degree in Brisbane.
- Github as only credentials unfortunately. Edge??, roster??, dpi??
- Built own web server and framework, and a number of modules, 
- Plans and ideas for multiple apps/utilities 
- Familiar and/or knowledgeable of most current libs/trends/frameworks/languages
- Not fond of OOPS, prefer functional approach
- Most current software in javascript, but also programmed (in the past) in C,
 Java and even Pascal and Basic.
- Favorite language: Lisp and any language like it (Clojure, CLisp, Scheme,
- Picolisp and interested in even more modern incarnations such as Julia)
- Studying CS curriculum when time allows
- As far as javascript concerned, interested in web apps, not so much web sites,
 and any technology that will make web apps easier to make, front and backend.
- Working knowledge of html and css (and sass and less etc), but not overly fond of it.
- Would love the opportunity to work with any of the more modern 
 languages such as Haskell, Julia, D, Rust, Go, Clojure and Scala, but sticking
 with Javascript for now for reasons of marketability.
- Dream project: write Lisp operating system..
- Main interest: computer systems' software reliability, robustness. Ultimately
 software should be somehow self repairing and self-reliant and with built-in redundancy, and as a whole extremely fault tolerant.  
- Developed some websites, IT support etc
- Developed roster, time tracking app.

My own personal website axion5.net lists and summarizes undertaken projects and websites.

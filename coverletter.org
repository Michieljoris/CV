Dear reader,



I believe the future is in the web as far as apps are concerned. I think I have
a clear idea of the direction of future web app development. I think I will be
able to contribute to a team of developers to develop quicker and better web
apps. 

My dream and I think it's possible for apps to self deploy ( as a teaser) also
with cckape as a teaser. . I'm looking for

similar minded people interested in building these using the best languages, the
smartest libraries and cleverest implementations resulting in fast deployment
and quick iteration. I am interested in learning and applying anything to
further that goal. See also my [[http://github.com/michieljoris/cape][cape]] project.

Small companies need creativity. 

Think consciously about strengths and weakkness.

Technologies?

Tak van sport (web apps). Mijn droom is self depl. and cape, > benefits to
business.

Then wie ben ik and vaardigheden. Breng het positief, not self-deprecating. 
Thorough with piano, thorough with next projects. 

Then skilss and knowledge.

I can explain things, I am a teacher.  Mary market

Rollen in een team die ik kan, en bijdrages die ik kan leveren vanuut mijn
positie> explainer, mentor, learn things quick, adapting quick, idea man,
initiator of new designs and ideas. Ja maar.  

I would like to ask for you to consider this cover letter somewhat more
carefully than you would normally. As you can see on the attached CV I have not
so many programming credentials to my name as you would normally see. Why it
might still be interesting for us to got get in contact is because of the
following:

- Despite not having a formal CS education I might still have enough coding
  chops to be of help to you. I am a self-taught programmer as I am a
  self-taught pianist. I finished a conservatorium degree without previous piano
  lessons, this still amazes me really. I have been at least as thorough, and
  still am, in educating myself in programming. I have been programming on and
  off since I was 13 years old. Piano and music was just an enormous challenge
  when I was 19 a diverted me in some sense from the direction I always was
  going to go anyway. See following point:
- I went to VWO (Science preparatory school), then started a maths degree in
  Leiden (then philosophy, picked up piano, then history, and finally piano).
- I have a thorough knowledge of javascript, having written it for a couple of
  years now. See my [[http://github.com/michieljoris][github]] account.
- Since learning of lisp it's my favorite language, however web apps are written
  in javascript. Maybe not anymore now. I'm switching to ClojureScript.
- To prove to myself I can write javascript I wrote my own server, build and
  module system. It does for me what most people use Express, Grunt and
  Browserify for.
- I'm familiar with and/or knowledgeable of most current
  libs/trends/frameworks/languages.
- Not fond of OOPS, prefer functional approach, I write javascript in a
  functional as much I can, avoiding /this/ wherever I can..
- Plans and ideas for multiple apps/utilities.
- Studying CS curriculum when time allows
- Interested in web apps, not so much web sites, and any technology that will
  make web apps easier to make, front and backend.
- Working knowledge of html and css (and sass and less etc), but not overly fond of it.
- Would love the opportunity to work with any of the more modern languages such
  as Haskell, Julia, D, Rust, Go, Clojure and Scala, but sticking with
  Javascript for now for reasons of marketability.
- Dream project: write Lisp operating system.. 
- Main interest: computer systems' software reliability, robustness. Ultimately
  software should be somehow self repairing, self-reliant and with built-in
  redundancy, and as a whole extremely fault tolerant.
- I even keep a [[http://www.axion5.net][blog]]!!
  
Interests beyond web applications are distributed programming, operating
systems, compilers but foremost robustness, reliability and ease of use of
computer systems. A computer shouldn't fail but it does so often.
